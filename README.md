# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

✊📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors – A Python Mini Game

This is a fun and interactive Python project that brings the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game to life in the terminal. The player goes head-to-head with the computer, which randomly selects its move each round.

🧠 What I Learn:

1--> How to use the random module
2--> Handling user input and validating choices
3-->Implementing conditional logic (if, elif, else)
4--> Using loops to keep the game running
5--> Basic game logic and control flow

✨ Features:

1-->Interactive gameplay via the command line
2-->Clean and simple user prompts
3--> Option to play multiple rounds
4--> Win/loss/tie feedback after each round

This project is perfect for Python beginners looking to strengthen their coding fundamentals while building something fun and engaging.
